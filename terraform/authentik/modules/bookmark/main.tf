# BOOKMARK MODULE FOR AUTHENTIK
# 
# This module creates:
# 1. An Authentik Application configured as a bookmark (similar to Okta bookmarks)
# 2. No providers - just links to external URLs
# 3. Binds appropriate groups to the application for access control

  # Determine which groups should have access based on access level
