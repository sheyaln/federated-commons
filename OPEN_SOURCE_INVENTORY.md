# Open Source Inventory

A complete inventory of open source software used in the Federated Commons infrastructure, categorized by their philosophy and business model.

## Special Thanks
*We extend our gratitude to these projects. Whether they are community-driven, non-profits, or "Good Actor" corporations, they provide fully-featured open source software without predatory limitations, SSO taxes, or hostile licenses.*

### Corporate Good Actors
*These companies monetize responsibly (e.g., hosting, support) without crippling the open source version.*

*   **Authentik** (Authentik Security Inc.) - Fully featured SSO IdP with very few, and truly enterprise-only features behind the paywall. [Donate](https://github.com/sponsors/BeryJu)
*   **Docker** (Docker Inc.) - The container engine itself remains a powerful open source standard.
*   **Grafana** (Grafana Labs) - Supports SAML/OIDC in the open source version.
*   **Invoice Ninja** (Invoice Ninja) - Fully featured invoicing. Payment is mostly for white-labeling or hosting.
*   **Leantime** (Leantime Inc.) - Project management with a generous open source edition.
*   **Nextcloud** (Nextcloud GmbH) - A massive suite of productivity tools with a solid open core.
*   **Wazuh** (Wazuh Inc.) - Enterprise-grade security platform that is fully open source.
*   **Zabbix** (Zabbix SIA) - 100% open source enterprise monitoring. No "Enterprise Edition".

## You Suck
*These projects employ "Open Core" or "Source Available" models that artificially restrict essential features—most notably security (SSO) and scalability—to force users into expensive enterprise plans. Or they are owned by IBM/Red Hat. We use you, but we see you.*

*   **Ansible** (Red Hat / IBM) - The industry standard for automation. Owned by IBM.
*   **EspoCRM** (EspoCRM) - **Paywalled Essentials.** Locks basic sales functionality (Quotes, Invoices, Orders) behind the paid "Sales Pack".
*   **n8n** (n8n GmbH) - **SSO Tax.** Single Sign-On (SAML) is locked behind the Enterprise plan (~€600/mo). Also uses a non-OSI "Fair Code" license.
*   **OnlyOffice** (Ascensio System SIA) - **Artificial Limits.** The free version is hard-coded to restrict concurrent connections.
*   **Outline** (Outline / General Linear Group) - **Hostile License.** Switched to the Business Source License (BSL), restricting usage for many organizations.
*   **Terraform** (HashiCorp / IBM) - **Hostile License.** Switched to the Business Source License (BSL). Owned by IBM.
*   **Traefik** (Traefik Labs) - **Crippled Features.** High Availability (clustering) is an Enterprise-only feature.
*   **Windmill** (Windmill Labs) - **SSO Tax.** SSO and granular permissions are locked behind commercial plans.
