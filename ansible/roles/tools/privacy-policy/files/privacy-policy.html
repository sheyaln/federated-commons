  <h1 class="centered">Privacy Policy v0.3</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Organization collects, uses, and handles limited
    personal information when members choose to access Organization’s internal digital
    tools and services.
  </p>

  <p>
    These tools are intended solely for internal, union-related use. Participation
    is voluntary and not required for union membership or involvement.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    When you sign in using our authentication system, we may collect basic account
    information necessary to provide access to internal services. This may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Profile image or avatar (if provided by your identity provider)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you choose to enable additional security features, such as multi-factor
    authentication, we may collect the information required to support that feature
    (for example, a phone number for SMS-based authentication).
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, and we do not
    use tracking technologies, advertising identifiers, or third-party analytics
    on our internal tools.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use collected information only for purposes necessary to operate and secure
    our internal services, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticating users and managing access to authorized tools</li>
    <li>Displaying basic account information within applications</li>
    <li>Maintaining system security and preventing abuse</li>
    <li>Supporting normal operational and administrative functions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We do not sell personal information and do not use it for advertising,
    profiling, or marketing purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Account-related information is stored only for as long as you maintain an
    account or require access to internal services.
  </p>

  <p>
    User-generated content created or uploaded through collaboration tools
    (including documents, files, logs, notes, or shared resources) may persist
    after account deletion if it is part of shared organizational records or
    collaborative work.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may retain limited information in backups, logs, or audit records for a
    reasonable period of time for security, operational, or legal purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data is protected using reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
    safeguards, including encryption in transit and at rest where supported by
    the underlying systems.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share personal information with third parties except where required
    by law or necessary to operate the services you have elected to use.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You may request account deletion or access changes at any time. Upon account
    removal, direct account identifiers will be removed where reasonably possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you believe personal data has been retained unnecessarily, you may request
    review or deletion by contacting us.
  </p>
